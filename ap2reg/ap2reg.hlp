The dependent variable is {it:depvar} and the covariatesare in {it:indepvars}. At least one covariate is mandatory. The specificationonly allows two time periods, that is, t must take two values only.{title:Specification}In period 1,		y = effect of explanatory variables + Individual effect + Unit effect + Residual		In period 2,				y = effect of explanatory variables + Individual effect 			+ Unit effect + Effect of the unit in period 1 + Residual{title:Identification constraints}The identification constraints for the fixed effects are set by conventionsuch that the sum of individual effects is equal to zero and such that the last unit fixed effect is zero.{title:Options}{it:depvar} is the dependent variable. No missing observation is allowed.{it:indepvars} lists explanatory variables. No missing observation is allowed.{cmdab:individual}{cmd:(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} is the identifier for the first fixed effect.Typically, {it:varname} will be an person's ID, such as an employee ID. {cmdab:unit}{cmd:(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} is the identifier for the second fixed effect.Typically, {it:varname} will be a unit ID, such as a firm ID. {cmdab:time}{cmd:(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} is the identifier for the time variable.
