The dependent variableis {it:depvar} and the covariates are in {it:indepvars}. At least one covariateis mandatory.{title:Identification constraints}The identification constraints for the fixed effects are set by conventionsuch that the sum of individual effects is equal to zero and such that the last unit fixed effect is zero.{title:Options}{it:depvar} is the dependent variable. No missing observation is allowed.{it:indepvars} lists explanatory variables. No missing observation is allowed.{cmdab:individual}{cmd:(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} is the identifier for the first fixed effect.Typically, {it:varname} will be an person's ID, such as an employee ID. {cmdab:unit}{cmd:(}{it:varname}{cmd:)} is the identifier for the second fixed effect.Typically, {it:varname} will be a unit ID, such as a firm ID. {cmdab:save}{cmd:(}{it:filename}{cmd:)} is the name of the output file (optional). This fileis a matrix saved with fputmatrix, with the coefficients of the covariates first,then the individual effects, and finally the unit fixed effects.

{cmdab:prefix}{cmd:(}{it:name}{cmd:)} is the prefix used to build the names of the betas. For
instance, the beta of the {it:varname} covariate will be stored in {it:prefix_varname}. If
no prefix is specified, 'effect' is assumed.
