This version, cg2_4v8, allows the user to specify a subset of the
covariates in the binary input file xxx.bin4 by preparing an xxx.vars
file that lists the variable names and indicies within the file.
It also uses these names to label output in the xxx.cglog, xxx.means 
and xxx.betas files. The formats of the xxx.means and xxx.betas files
are the same as before with the variable names appended to the output line.
If no xxx.vars file exists, all variables are selected and the default 
names Y and X1,X2 etc are used.

If the user decides to use a subset of the covariates, the number of covariates
in the xxx.cgin file is the number in the subset, not the total number of covariates.

The format of the xxx.vars file is one line for each variable, starting
with the dependent variable, then the covariates, then the person variable and
lastly the firm variable. By convention, the program assumes the firm variable
is the last variable on the input record. 

Each line has a variable name and an index within the xxx.bin4 file. The indices
MUST be in ascending order. For example, with 3 of 5 covariates selected
the file xxx.vars would be:

LogWages  1
cov1      2
cov3      4
cov5      6
person    7
firm      8
