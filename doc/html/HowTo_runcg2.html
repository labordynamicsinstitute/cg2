<h2>HowTo Run CG2</h2>

<br>

With the pre-processing steps complete you should have a binary input
file named <span style="font-style: italic;">cgout4</span> and the size of the problem stored in
<span style="font-style: italic;">runcg/02_size_calc.lst</span>. &nbsp;You are now ready to run CG2, from the <span style="font-style: italic;">02_runcg_out</span> directory.<br>

<ol>

  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">runcg2.ksh</span> script will call <span style="font-style: italic;">cg2_4v3</span> for you and setup
everything the program needs to run. &nbsp;The first line of the script
should point to either the bash or ksh shell (by default <span style="font-style: italic;">/bin/bash</span>).
&nbsp;Open the script in a text editor and make sure that the CG
variable points to the correct location of the <span style="font-style: italic;">cg2_4v3</span> binary on your
system. &nbsp;The <span style="font-family: monospace;">PROGDIR</span> variable should contain the name of the
directory containing the correct <span style="font-style: italic;">02_size_calc.lst</span> file.</li>

  <li>At the prompt type <span style="font-family: monospace;">./runcg2.ksh </span>or <span style="font-family: monospace;">./runcg2.ksh &amp;</span> to put the process in the background.</li>

  <li>There are two log files. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Runcg.log</span> contains output from the
script, such as when CG2 started and finished, while <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.cglog</span> contains
output from CG2. &nbsp;You can monitor the progress of CG2 by looking
at <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.cglog</span> periodically. &nbsp;The size of the problem and memory
allocated should match what you expect. &nbsp;The first step is to read
the data, the second stage preconditions the data, the third stage
searches for the optimal paramater estimates, and in the final step the
results are output.</li>

  <li>Optional. &nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">cgout</span>
directory contains&nbsp;the synthetic data CG2 output files from the
reference system. &nbsp;Compare these with your <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.betas</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.means</span>
file to test your installation. &nbsp;</li>

</ol>

If you are successful two output files will be created<br>

<br>

<ol>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">cg.betas</span> - Text file containing your parameter estimates.
&nbsp;The covariates or right hand side variables are listed first,
followed by the fixed person effects, and&nbsp;finally the firm effects
minus one. &nbsp;Since all of the person effects are estimated no
constant is included in the model. &nbsp;The covariates are correct as
reported by CG2, but the person and firm effects are not identified at
this point. &nbsp;The post-processing imposes the identification rules
in the next stage.</li>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">cg.means</span> - The mean of the dependent variable and each covariate.
&nbsp;Can be used to check if CG2 read in the data correctly and are
used in the post-processing.</li>

</ol>
