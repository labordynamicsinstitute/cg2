<h2>How To Library</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>


The first step is to ensure&nbsp;all of the required software is available (see the <a href="index.html">main page</a>
for more details). &nbsp;If you are lucky your system administrator
will take care of installing SAS and the Fortran compilers for you.
&nbsp;Once that task is done, you can proceed to <a href="Howto_compile.html">compiling the CG2 source code</a>. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

Don't forget to download the SAS programs and unzip them to a project
directory. &nbsp;The zip file creates three directories: runcg,
runcg_out, and cgpost. &nbsp;The section below provides more details on
using the software.<br>

<h3>Using CG2</h3>

Now that CG2 is&nbsp;set up, you can finally begin analyzing some data!
&nbsp;However, before actually estimating model parameters, you must
properly structure the input file and calculate the size of the
problem. &nbsp;With the input data ready, the next step is to run CG2
and calculate parameter estimates. &nbsp;The final step is
post-processing the estimates, although this may not be required
depending on the set of parameters you are interested in.<br>

<br>

The SAS programs as packaged are setup to use a purely fictional,
synthetic dataset. &nbsp;It is a good idea to run through each HowTo on
the synthetic data first before attempting a problem of your own.
&nbsp;This will give you an opportunity to become familiar with each
stage of the process as well as test your installation.<br>

Typographical convention: We have tried to be consistent throughout in the use of typographical convention:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">italics</span> designate a <span style="font-style: italic;">file</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">directory</span> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">type-writer</span> characters are used to designate <br>
<ul>
  <li>either <span style="font-family: monospace;">variables</span> within programs,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>or <span style="font-family: monospace;">commands</span> you type at the command prompt</li>
</ul>
