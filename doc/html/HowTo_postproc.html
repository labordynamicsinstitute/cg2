<h2>HowTo Post-Process the CG2 Output</h2>


<br>


The post-processing&nbsp;backs out the constant (a=y-xb) and imposes the
identification rules. &nbsp;The person and firm effects are only
identified within connected groups. &nbsp;The first step involves
identifying the groups present in your data. &nbsp;The group
information is combined with the CG2 parameter estimates and a final SAS dataset
is produced.<br>

<br>

<h3>The Groups Program</h3>

The grouping program identifies the set(s) of persons and firms that
are connected to each other. &nbsp;Connectedness is most easily defined
through an example. &nbsp;Pick any firm in the data and identify all
the workers ever employed at the firm. &nbsp;Then identify all of the
firms each employee ever worked at. &nbsp;For the new expanded set of
firms identify all of the workers ever employed at those firms.
&nbsp;Repeat the algorthm until no more firms/workers can be added.
&nbsp;Labor market data typically has 95+ percent of the workers and
firms in the first group with the rest of the workers in many small
groups.<br>

<br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">groups</span> program is crucial since the persons and firm effects are
only identified within a group (unless you are willing to make some
assumptions). &nbsp;This information must be available before any
identification rule can be implemented.<br>

<ol>

  <li>Go to the <span style="font-style: italic;">02_runcg_out/groups</span> directory.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">firmcells.sas</span> program, creating the <span style="font-style: italic;">firmcells</span> file.
&nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">firmcells</span> file is the same as <span style="font-style: italic;">cellsout</span>, but it is sorted by
firm ID, person ID.</li>

  <li>Open the <span style="font-style: italic;">rungroups.ksh</span> file with a text editor. &nbsp;At the
bottom of the file make sure that the location of the <span style="font-style: italic;">groups</span> binary is
correct (use an explicit path. &nbsp;Some versions of Unix have a
system groups program). &nbsp;Run <span style="font-style: italic;">rungroups.ksh</span></li>

  <li>Examine <span style="font-style: italic;">groups.log</span> for any errors</li>

  <li>Run <span style="font-style: italic;">groupstats.sas</span> if you are interested in the number and size of the groups (the synthetic data should only have two groups).</li>

</ol>


<h3>Identification</h3>

The final stage involves calculating the constant, bringing in the
parameter estimates, imposing the identification rule, and decomposing
earnings into various components (constant, xb, experience, person,
firm, h=person + exper).<br>

<br>

<ol>

  <li>Go to the <span style="font-style: italic;">03_cgpost</span> directory</li>

  <li>Open the <span style="font-style: italic;">config_param.sas</span> file with a text editor. &nbsp;Set the
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">depvar</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">persid</span>, and <span style="font-family: monospace;">firmid</span> macro variables. &nbsp;Set the <span style="font-family: monospace;">betadir</span> macro
variable to the location where you ran <span style="font-style: italic;">cg2</span>. &nbsp;Skip down a few lines
and set the <span style="font-family: monospace;">rhs</span> macro variable appropriately.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">00_setup.sas</span> program. &nbsp;Make sure you run it twice
the first time or the program will not finish properly. &nbsp;The
program automatically creates the <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.coef</span> file used by other programs
and sets up links to <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.betas, cg.in</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">cg.means</span>.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">01_rhs.ksh</span> shell script with the first argument <span style="font-family: monospace;">cg.</span>
&nbsp;The script generates a SAS program that creates a SAS dataset
(<span style="font-style: italic;">rhs.sas7bdat</span>) containing the covariates (betas) from the CG2 run.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">02_means_2v3.ksh</span> script with the argument <span style="font-family: monospace;">cg</span>. &nbsp;The
script generates a SAS program that creates a SAS dataset
(<span style="font-style: italic;">means02.sas7bdat</span>) containing the means of the dependent and right hand
side variables.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">03_constant.sas</span> program. &nbsp;Creates the constant using the property that a regression goes through the means.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">04_fe_read.sas</span> program. &nbsp;Reads in the groups, person
effects, and the firm effects and creates SAS datasets for each of them
in the same location where CG2 was run (<span style="font-style: italic;">groups.sas7bdat,
theta.sas7bdat, psi.sas7bdat</span>).</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">05_xb.sas</span> program. &nbsp;Calculates the Xb and experience
index for each observation (stored in <span style="font-style: italic;">xb.sas7bdat</span>). &nbsp;Depending on
the specification of experience in your model you may need to modify
this program.</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">06_join_all.sas</span> program. &nbsp;Brings all of the
components (groups, person, firm, xb, exper) together into one file
(<span style="font-style: italic;">hcest1.sas7bdat</span>).</li>

  <li>Run the <span style="font-style: italic;">07_identify.sas</span> program. &nbsp;The first step is
identifying the model. &nbsp;The person effects are set to mean zero
within each group. &nbsp;In contrast, the firm effects are assumed mean
zero within each group, and the extra degree of freedom is used to
estimate an additional firm effect. &nbsp;The firm effects are set to
mean zero for the entire sample only. &nbsp;Everything is almost ready
except for groups there are usually some groups where we cannot
separately identify the person and firm effect (only one person and one
firm). &nbsp;For these groups I randomly draw a person and firm effect
from a distribution similar to the overall distributions. &nbsp;Our
measure of human capital (h) and the residuals are calculated.</li>
