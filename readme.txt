Enclosed is the grouping and the cg program. I need to document the source code of cg; the grouping program is implemented in C (compiled with GCC on Cygwin), and looks for the same input file as the original fortran code (size in groups.in and cellsbyp.txt, cellsbys.txt). The source is still a bit messy. I hope you will make it run.
 
Furthermore, I've added a program to create LaTeX correlation tables straight after the estimation.
